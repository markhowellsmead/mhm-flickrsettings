Provides WordPress backend settings fields to store Flickr configuration information.

== Description ==

Install and activate the plugin as usual. The activated plugin adds three fields to the Media settings page in the admin area: key (`flickr_key`), secret (`flickr_secret`) and user ID (`flickr_userid`) for use with the Flickr API. The values saved to these fields can then be used via the WordPress `get_option()` function in a theme or unrelated plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your Flickr user data using the fields available under Settings Â» Media.
