#Flickr settings plugin

##Description
Provides WordPress backend settings fields to store Flickr configuration information.

##Usage
Install and activate the plugin as usual. The activated plugin adds three fields to the Media settings page in the admin area: key, secret and user ID. The values saved to these fields can then be used via the WordPress `get_option()` function in a theme or unrelated plugin.
